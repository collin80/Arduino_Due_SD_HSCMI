// Including Arduino_Due_SD_HSCMI library also creates SD object (MassStorage class)
#include <Arduino_Due_SD_HSCMI.h> // This creates the object SD

// We need to create FileInfo object, we will be using it for creating list of files.
FileInfo aboutFile;

float write_time=0; // to record

  delay(1000); // 1s delay so you have enough time to open Serial Terminal
  // Check if there is card inserted
  SD.Init(); // Initialization of HSCMI protocol and SD socket switch GPIO (to adjust pin number go to library source file - check Getting Started Guide)

/* Following code creates files "data1", "data2", "data3" and "data4" in dir "0:" and "data5", "data6", "data7" and "data8" in dir "test" and writes data to them. Alsi it performs speed test. 
 * Than it creates list of files on card. 
   This is made in setup function since we want to do that once. Check Getting Started Guide for Debug options (Debug is enabled by default). 

   CAUTION!
   Code only works if there is no directory or file with the same name. Code first checks if name is alredy used when is needed. */
